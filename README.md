# PyADB


Python wrapper for the [Android Device Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html) that allows for multiple devices to be connected simultaneously.

## To Do

I've created a function that will record and replay screen actions using Python's Pickle, but this will be either removed or edited to serve an alternate purpose on the next release.  If I remember correctly, Android 7.0 currently has a method of replaying touch coordinates in a similar way.  There are also a ton of Open-Sourced projects on Github that accomplish the same thing in a much cleaner way.

I will also add a method of interacting with both USB devices and ADB over wifi devices.
